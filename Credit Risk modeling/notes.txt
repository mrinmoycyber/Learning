For bank prespective - 
Asset  - Loan product (which gives us profit)
In banking, assets are what the bank owns or invests in to generate income.
Loans given to customers are considered assets, because:
The bank expects to receive future cash flows (in the form of principal + interest).
Loans earn interest, which is the primary source of income for a bank.
| Loan Type       | Why It's an Asset                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Housing Loan    | Customer repays with interest → cash inflow |
| Personal Loan   | High interest rate → more profit for bank   |
| Auto Loan, etc. | Any lending product is considered an asset  |


Liability - Liabilities are what the bank owes to customers — i.e., sources of funds the bank must eventually return.
Customer deposits (like savings, current, fixed deposits) are liabilities because:
The bank borrows this money from customers.
Customers can withdraw it anytime (in case of savings/current) or after maturity (FD).
Bank pays interest on these (a cost for the bank).

| Deposit Type    | Why It's a Liability                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Savings Account | Bank owes this money to the customer       |
| Current Account | Same as above, but often no interest paid  |
| Fixed Deposit   | Higher interest paid → long-term liability |

CASA: Current Account Savings Account
TD: Term Deposit (also called Time Deposit or Fixed Deposit - FD)

NPA - Non Performing Asset
NPA - Loan that is defaulted

1.Disbursed Amount - Loan amount given to a customer
2.OSP - Out Standing Principle
1 lakh loan taken
8k EMI
I already paid 40k
left 60k is my OSP

OSP should be zero at the end of loan cycle.

3.DPD - Days Past Due
Suppose my due date was 10th april and I paid on 12 April. 
DPD = 2 days
DPD should ideally zero
Now the person is "Defaulted" 
"Defaulted" DPD > 0

4. PAR - Portfolio at risk
OSP when DPD > 0

5.NPA - Loan Account when DPD > 90 days

# Credit Risk Types in banking
DPD (zero) - NDA (Non delinquint Account)
DPD (0 to 30) - SMA1 (Standar Monitoring Account)
DPD (31 to 60) - SMA2 (Standar Monitoring Account)
DPD (61 to 90) - SMA3 (Standar Monitoring Account)
DPD (90 to 180) - NPA
DPD (>180) - write-off (Loan which is not present, bank removed it from it book)

A write-off is an accounting action where the bank removes the loan amount from its books as an asset.

Why does the bank write off the loan?
Loan is irrecoverable — the borrower is not paying at all.
To clean up the balance sheet and show a healthier asset portfolio.
Required by accounting standards (IFRS/GAAP) and regulatory bodies (like RBI) when the loan is overdue for a long time.
