For bank prespective - 
Asset  - Loan product (which gives us profit)
In banking, assets are what the bank owns or invests in to generate income.
Loans given to customers are considered assets, because:
The bank expects to receive future cash flows (in the form of principal + interest).
Loans earn interest, which is the primary source of income for a bank.
| Loan Type       | Why It's an Asset                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Housing Loan    | Customer repays with interest → cash inflow |
| Personal Loan   | High interest rate → more profit for bank   |
| Auto Loan, etc. | Any lending product is considered an asset  |


Liability - Liabilities are what the bank owes to customers — i.e., sources of funds the bank must eventually return.
Customer deposits (like savings, current, fixed deposits) are liabilities because:
The bank borrows this money from customers.
Customers can withdraw it anytime (in case of savings/current) or after maturity (FD).
Bank pays interest on these (a cost for the bank).

| Deposit Type    | Why It's a Liability                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Savings Account | Bank owes this money to the customer       |
| Current Account | Same as above, but often no interest paid  |
| Fixed Deposit   | Higher interest paid → long-term liability |

CASA: Current Account Savings Account
TD: Term Deposit (also called Time Deposit or Fixed Deposit - FD)

NPA - Non Performing Asset
NPA - Loan that is defaulted

1.Disbursed Amount - Loan amount given to a customer
2.OSP - Out Standing Principle
1 lakh loan taken
8k EMI
I already paid 40k
left 60k is my OSP
OSP should be zero at the end of loan cycle.

3.DPD - Days Past Due
Suppose my due date was 10th april and I paid on 12 April. 
DPD = 2 days
DPD should ideally zero
Now the person is "Defaulted" 
"Defaulted" DPD > 0

4. PAR - Portfolio at risk
OSP when DPD > 0

5.NPA - Loan Account when DPD > 90 days

# Credit Risk Types in banking
DPD (zero) - NDA (Non delinquint Account)
DPD (0 to 30) - SMA1 (Standar Monitoring Account)
DPD (31 to 60) - SMA2 (Standar Monitoring Account)
DPD (61 to 90) - SMA3 (Standar Monitoring Account)
DPD (90 to 180) - NPA
DPD (>180) - write-off (Loan which is not present, bank removed it from it book)

A write-off is an accounting action where the bank removes the loan amount from its books as an asset.

Why does the bank write off the loan?
Loan is irrecoverable — the borrower is not paying at all.
To clean up the balance sheet and show a healthier asset portfolio.
Required by accounting standards (IFRS/GAAP) and regulatory bodies (like RBI) when the loan is overdue for a long time.

NPA 2 parts - 
GNPA - Gross NPA (3-5 %) 
Gross NPA = Total value of all loans that are not being repaid properly (i.e., defaulted loans).
| Particular                  | Value         |
| --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Total Loans by Bank         | ₹10,000 crore |
| Total Defaulted Loans (NPA) | ₹500 crore    |
Here GNPA is 500 crore
GNPA = Total Defaulted Loans
Formula:
GNPA Ratio = Total NPAs (without provisioning) / (Total Gross Advances/ total Loans) × (100)
= 500 / 10,000 * 100 = 5%
So, 5% of the bank’s loans are in default. This is Gross NPA.

Interpretation: Reflects the overall asset quality of the bank.
                A high GNPA (e.g., 3–5%) shows that many loans are turning bad.
                NNPA - Net NPA (0.01 to 0.06%) = Provisioning Amount Subtracted

What is Provisioning?
Banks set aside some money from their profits in advance to cover expected losses from NPAs. This is called provisioning.

You can think of it like:
You lent ₹10,000 to your friend.
You think ₹8,000 is lost.
So you mentally write off ₹8,000 — that’s provisioning.
You still hope to recover something.

Net NPA (NNPA)?
Net NPA = GNPA – Provisioning
Why?
It tells the actual loss or risk the bank still carries after setting aside the buffer.
If a bank provisioned well, NNPA will be low.

| Item                     | Value      |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Total NPA (GNPA)         | ₹500 crore |
| Provisioning Done        | ₹400 crore |
| Net NPA (Remaining Risk) | ₹100 crore |

NNPA Ratio=  (Total Loans – Provision) / (GNPA – Provision) * 100

500 - 400 / 10,000 - 400 * 100 = 100/9600 * 100 = 1.04 %
